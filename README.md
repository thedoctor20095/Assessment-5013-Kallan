Privacy Principle Source of Personal Information:
- so to make sure that we are receiving the information from the correct source I would make it so that we send them an email asking them to confirm that they are indeed the person supplying information and that they are indeed the person that the information is about. 
- If the information is not coming from the the person concerned we need to check that they are someone who has been authorised by the person about whom the information is concerned.

Privacy Principle Collection of Information from a subject:
- to make sure that the information that the subject is aware that we are collecting information/Consenting us Collecting information about them we will have a "Checkbox" that says do you consent to us collecting and holding this information?
- we will also send them an email after the account/information has been collected to re-confirm that they know we are holding this information.

Privacy Principle Storage and Security of Personal Information:
- we will make it so that no one can access the information freely unless they have permission either from the person the information is about.
- we will make sure to have multiple Firewalls etc. and maybe have the information stored off site from the main business where Applicable

Privacy Principle Correction of Personal Information:
- to allow people to update/change their information depending on how sensitive the information is we would require different levels of security checks, so access to change public information just requires basic confirmation but if they want to update information that is more private we would require some kind of Photo ID. or email them a code to their confirmed email address 
- When the information has been updated we would need to ask them "Is this information to the best of your knowledge accurate and correct" as we dont want to accidently have the information to be incorrect/inaccurate

Privacy Principle Purpose of Collection of Personal Information:
- so to ensure that we are recieving information that lies within the parameters of our business scope we will ensure that only the relevant information can be input into our information collection page.
- we will also get the Privacy Officer that we employ to check over the information that we are requesting and seeing if it is within the scope of our business or not.


Part 2
The Website I have chosen for creating a Privacy Policy is Facebook. The URL is Facebook.com. The main point of this website is mainly a communications platform between family, friends and coworkers. Though it is has somewhat recently become an advertising platform. The data that Facebook collects is everything that you upload to their site and also information that you donâ€™t upload as they can see your IP, look through your Browser History and so much more.

Please refer to the document "privacyPolicy_20200773.doc" for my Privacy Policy for Facebook
